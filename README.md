# symplany-code-challenge
Build a simulation for the card game 'war'.

### As a reminder, the rules to War are as follows:
- A deck of cards is dealt to two players
- Each player will show the top card on their stack
- The person with the higher card gets the other person's card
- If there is a tie, then each player places 3 cards face down, then a face-up card. Again, the player with the higher card gets the whole pot. If there is another tie, then this process (3 cards down, 1 card up) repeats
- A player wins when they collect the entire deck
